This project is a mobile application that I will be developing over the next few weeks/months.
The application will allow the user to Input a food or drink and in return will be provided the user with the 
average amount of Carbs per serving for that input. The application will then convert this value into the "reccomend"
amount of Insulin a Type 1 Diabetic should take for the before consuming the food/drink. Screenshots of the Application 
will be provided later on in the Development of the project.

This is currently the a very basic early version of the UI while I begin the development of the API.

I will also be using my Trello board to keep my on track and make sure the development of the application is going as planned
